<h2>MY KEY FEATURES</h2>

    <ul> I am type of person that always put my family first and What family really means to myself is love. Someone who is always there for me throughout my life, in both good and bad times. Family to me means encouragement, comfort, advice, values, morals, faith, understanding, hope and lots more. These things are extremely important to me as they make me to feel happy inside regardless of whatever is happening in my external life.</ul>

    <ul>  One of the most important mental goal of anyone’s life is to be secured all the time. And family is the one which will provide you that sense of security. However, the strength of family is not an important factor here. All your need is few people around you, under whom you can feel secure and you are done.</ul>

  <p>  <ul>If you want to live a positive, joyful life, you cannot be surrounded by negative people who don’t encourage your happiness.
As a negative person, I attracted negative people. When I decided to make the change to live a more positive life, I had to rid my life of the most negative influences in it. No one is perfect and perfection isn’t the goal when it comes to positivity but there were people in my life who were consistently negative, who constantly brought me down, and I had to stop spending so much time with them.</ul> </p>

<p> BEFORE I END OF MY PAGE THIS IS SOME REMINDER TO ALL OF YOU</P>
  <P> <LL> In every person, in every situation, there is something good. Most of the time it’s not obvious. We have to look. And sometimes we have to look hard.

<p>The old me was content to sit back and just glance around. If I saw negative, I went with that feeling. I didn’t want to look harder or think too much about the good. I found it much, much easier to sit back and just accept what I saw (which was usually the bad).</p></ll>

Now, when I’m faced with a difficult or challenging situation, I think to myself, “What is good about this?” No matter how terrible the situation might seem, I always can find something good if I take the time to think about it.

Everything good and bad is a learning experience so, at the very least, you can learn from bad experiences. However, there’s usually even more to it than that. If you really take the time to look, you will usually find something good, something genuinely positive, about every person or situation.</P>
